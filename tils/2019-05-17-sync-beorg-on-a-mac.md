I've recently moved from vim to emacs (specifically spacemacs) as my full time editor. Org-mode was a large motivation for that switch. Being able to access some org-mode documents with my phone can be very helpfuly as well.  I have been using [beorg](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/beorg-to-do-list-agenda/id1238649962?mt=8) recently. Beorg gives you the option of syncing with a few services. I use iCloud heavily, so I opted for that.

This is easy to use on your mac if you find the location that beorg syncs, which happens to be `~/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~com~appsonthemove~beorg/Documents/org`.

Here, beorg has a default `inbox.org` for managing TODOs, but will keep any structure of org mode files as well.
